How do I say “I love you”
I’m bad at words 
But I bear your memory 
I want to be by your side and just feel the sun 
Let’s go on a run! I hate running but why not? 
Let’s go grocery shopping, I enjoy it but it’s not the same without you 

I’m constantly looking over hoping that if I believe hard enough you’d be here

But you’re so far away now, and what would I do if all my friends were machines too?
