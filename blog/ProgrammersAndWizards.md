Software development feels a whole like wizardry to me. 


every time I use git I feel my self shifting sands of brnaches of timelines as I control wha the sacred timeline is meant to be

That i can cherry pick evolving realtities.


that when i use vim and vscode shortcuts I am fundamentlaly altering the nature of the world that I am progrmamign in
that I can manipulate the matter that builds up that space. 



That the compter enginereing peopel are wizards carving runes into the earth to harness lightning so that us programmers can try and breath it consisiouness.
