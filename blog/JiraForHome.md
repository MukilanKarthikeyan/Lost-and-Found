## Welcome to the Atlasian Family
New startup idea: Jira tickets for families! 
Get yourself a PM for your family and get those tasks churning


Jira tickets are a way for teams in large corporations to “efficiently” track and organize the tasks and responsibilities and progress across a team. We recognise that during the holiday season many dysfunctional or situational relationships are put under a lot of stress and cause an increase in fighting between stressed out couples.

here at Atlasian care about your mental and emotional health. That’s why we’re excited to bring you JiraFam! For Home. 

Using JiraFam! You can now effeciently track all the chores that you have to get done before Santa comes to town, but most impotently before your nosey good for nothing mother-in-law can find something to complain about. 


And by organising tasks in a place that is easily accessible to you and your loved ones you can rest easy knowing how many story points it takes to put up a Christmas tree! Or organize the guest list, or pack you luggage. There’s so much you could be doing to celebrate the cheer and we don’t want you to be bogged down. So why not bring a little bit of work place efficiency into your home this Holiday season? 

Because every family needs a Project manager (you’re SO is really your project amiright? [ don’t tell your mother in law we called your spouse a work in progress, legal fees will not be covered, Atlasian is not liable for any damages, broken families, or bad holidays])

## YA Personality

It’s a dark future, you’re trapped in a hellscape where when you graduate high school you must take a test to determine your strengths and weaknesses and also your personality type. This is now the truth and the entire trust of you life will be defined with these classifications and if you ever disobey it it doesn’t work actually because no that’s not how you’re supposed to be a human, you think this is stupid and how could this ever happen but really it was some well meaning guy who was trying to figure out how he could think about humans and how they work but it’s been misconstrued into factions

This is what MBTI and Clifton strengths did in an alternate universe of Divergent 
You are a YA dystopian fiction female protagonist. You’re lot like the other girls
