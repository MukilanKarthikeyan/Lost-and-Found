I love wet socks, not hat that icky feelings of water sloshing nor the stubbornness of damp wool, nor the way my feet wrinkle at the thought of puddles I doge on the way to the bus stop on a rainy day
But I do love the freedom of a watery sock, you need not worry bout getting any wetter
You’re free to jump in any puddle to the hearts content 
And knowing that when you take them off you’ve got a warm wood waiting to greet you back home
And how much you’ve taken it for granted 
And for that reminder I love wet socks
 
Inst it strange, do you feel great to be feeling the pain 
That you feel so greatly and that you feel so much 
Don’t you feel alive
Don’t you feel the blood rushing your veins and the tears burning your eyes
Don’t you feel how hard it’s to breath when you’re choking for air 
When heart hurts to beat you know it’s thump thump thumping away 
Don’t you adorn your misery in bright golden frames that line the halls 

It’s just as beautiful as the mountains up top 
The quite breeze and that hugs your face
And the ever dancing green found in every place
Oh so sweet the fluffy clouds of sunny days and the rolling fog and blinding haze 
Oh the sharp tickling of ginger and warm bubbling laughter around the bright flames
And the ugly crying after the fires gone out and the people have gone home
And the soft knock on your door as your friends come check in 
The ping ping ping of your phone call as the car pulls away 

I love it all for I feel it all 
I experiment it all 
And each thought and experience I am carved 
For I love it all 
And I love my wet socks
