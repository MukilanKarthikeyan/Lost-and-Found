When you build with Purpose there is no burnout. (A brief reflection on Fall 2024)


This was an important lesson I saw first hand. I could spend hours doing things I loved (presenting what I knew of Robotics to a new cohort) or things I didn't particularly enjoy (but had to be done like budgeting) and come out the other end wanting to do more at RoboJackets. But nothing bruned me out like having to spend an unreasonable amount of time guessing arbritatry undocumented software architecture of the assignments for a specfic "intro to" course that will go unnamed here. 


The difference to me was all about knowing why.

At Robojackets I knew that everything I did was becasue I wanted to build a team from scratch and give them enough resources, knowldege, and sturcture so that the team will continue to succeed far beyond my tenure. 
Coming into the semester the only team members returning were me and Jackie Machale and a whole lot of uncertanity.
And now I am proud of the team we've built today. The hardest part in any team is getting feedback about what you do. But the poeple kept comming back every week and that means you're doing something right. 


Your team culture is defined by your leadership, especially when building from form the foundations. The poeple you recruit, the ones who choose to belive in your vision of a future will reflect how you show up.
The key to RoboRacing's success is the honesty and consistency. We built a culture that did not shy away form ugly truths or hiding how diffuclt of a road we had to walk. 
Now every team needs someone calling the shots and it must be the person with grand visions pushing the envelope and have impeccable decision making. When the current leader no longer fits teh bill a new one will arise but often executive heiarchies struggle to catch up if they ever do. 

There is a lot more I want say about leadership and the specfic issues i ran into wresltign with ROS and webotsSim but in the spirit of not flooding your feed I will save that for another time. 


I am honored to have gotten the chance to have been able to pave a path for a new set of students to take up the mantel.
And that I got to work on everything from the Nvidia hardware, ROS2 to teaching the team and making the difficult admin decisions and budgets. 
And I am glad I got to find a calling and obsess over robotics last semester.


I am incredibly lucky for the oppertunity to build an organzizational foundation from technical to social at RoboRacing. Thank you to those who belived in my vision of a future and congregated to make it happen. 


As I head of to Blue Origin this spring I wanted to take a moment to look back a the last semester. 
I am currently sitting at the gate to my flight writing this.
I am excited to join an incredible team on the next improbable mission.

While you make have particuallry great days and ocassionally a miserable day it's always been about the consistency.
Setting out to manifest an Idea is terrifying but if you cna find the right people I am convinced you can build improbable things.
