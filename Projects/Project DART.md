Project DART

2024.05.04 
I spent some time inspecting the outofdarts little rocket project as this is a recreation. 
I used onshape to CAD the handle, plunger, tube, o-rings, and I used an old measurement for the rival dart. So much of my time was actually spent trying to figure out what o-ring size and polycarb tube to get and where to get them from. Had a furitless earch for springs but I ended up at McMaster-CAAR to get springs and looking for a flast end stpring that has an outer dimater less than 26 and has around 5-15kg of force for it to be any good at firing the dart we are looking at the upper end. 
I ended up on a tube size of 26mmID and a tube length of 80mm to have some air volume. This is importatn as the spring is also 80mm but will have compression when isntalled. the compressed elngth must not be too long because it hits 40mm plus the 15mm for plunger top which leaves us with less than 30mm of air volume. 
MUST LOOK for new springs.

Looking into the catalog for McCaster and found project item: 2006N415
which is a spring that is less than 80mm long but has a compression length of 22mm and force of 20lbs 
will also experiment with the 5.2lbs force on the springs to see how much is actually launched.
